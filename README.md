Assignment: Advanced JavaScript and Tailwind CSS
Scenario
In this assignment, you’ll build a responsive static website to convert between metric units and imperial units (i.e., between kilograms and pounds, kilometres and miles, and Celsius and Fahrenheit). 
Equipment and Materials
For this assignment, you will need:
•	Visual Studio Code
•	Tailwind CSS Play CDN
•	Internet browser
Instructions
1.	Before you start, review the Scenario and Marking Criteria sections, and then read all the instructions.
2.	Working in groups, as indicated by your instructor, review the mathematical equations required to perform the following unit conversions:
•	Pounds (lb.) to kilograms (kg), and vice versa
•	Miles to kilometres (km), and vice versa
•	Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F), and vice versa
3.	Create a higher-order JavaScript function that takes in two parameters: 
•	The unit of measurement to convert from
•	The unit of measurement to convert to
The function should return a conversion function that uses arrow notation to perform the conversion. The conversion function should take in a single value or an array of values and return the converted value or array of converted values.
 
4.	Develop a basic static website that uses the JavaScript conversion functions you created.
Website requirements:
•	The website must be made responsive using Tailwind CSS.
•	Create three tabs within the navbar of the website: Weight, Distance and Temperature.
o	Each tab must have a form to convert from the metric unit to the imperial unit, and vice versa.
o	The form must contain the functionality to convert a single value and an array list of values.
•	Use Tailwind CSS for all the components on the website (e.g., navbar, tabs, forms)
5.	Deploy the website.
6.	Submit the following to Brightspace by the posted due date:
•	A link to your GitHub repository
•	A link to your deployed website
Note: Because this is a group assignment, only one submission per group is required.
